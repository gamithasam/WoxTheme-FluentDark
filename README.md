# Fluent Dark theme for [Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox)

![](https://github.com/gamithasam/WoxTheme-FluentDark/blob/master/sample.png?raw=true)

A dark theme for Wox inspired by Microsoft's [Fluent Design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/) and their [PowerToys Run](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/PowerToys-Run-Overview) tool.

## Instructions

Simply copy the `FluentLight.xaml` theme file to your Wox's `Themes` directory.

## Remarks

Wox's theme [fixes the result height to 50px](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/blob/324dc8e4cfad3a47c88bbac3fc526d6fec0dbfad/Wox/ResultListBox.xaml#L23) so I couldn't match PowerToys' design perfectly.

PowerToys Run itself seems to be based on Wox with some heavy modifications.

I created this theme by doing some modifications of [this light theme](https://github.com/gunt3001/WoxTheme-FluentLight). So if you want the light version you can check that out too. This readme file is also created by doing some modifications to their readme file.
